# Difference-between-public-and-private-class-in-C++with-simple area calculation example:

In the first part of the code,
-  The data member radius is public so we are allowed to access it outside the class

Second part of the code,

-The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the functions inside the class.
-They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class
